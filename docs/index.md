Roda is a Roblox Studio plugin designed to streamline the process of editing structured data in ModuleScripts, which can serve as a backend database system for any in-game items or elements. While you can edit ModuleScripts directly in Roblox Studio to achieve the same result, Roda offers a user-friendly UI with faster, more efficient methods and convenient features to manage and modify a wide variety of game components, including:
??? list
    - Items (e.g., weapons, armor, consumables, tools, currency, collectibles)
    - Dialogs (e.g., NPC conversations, quest prompts, player interactions)
    - NPCs (e.g., characters, enemies, merchants, quest givers, guards)
    - Skills (e.g., player abilities, magic spells, combat moves, crafting recipes)
    - Quests (e.g., objectives, rewards, progression stages, prerequisites)
    - Player Data (e.g., stats, inventory, progress, achievements, preferences)
    - Buffs (e.g., speed boosts, damage increase, healing over time, stat enhancements)
    - Debuffs (e.g., slow effects, damage reduction, poison, confusion, stat penalties)
    - Status Effects (e.g., stun, freeze, burn, invisibility, regeneration)
    - Challenges (e.g., timed trials, obstacle courses, boss battles, survival modes)
    - Perks (e.g., passive abilities, bonus rewards, unique traits, class-specific bonuses)
    - Power-Ups (e.g., temporary boosts, invincibility, double jump, speed surges)
    - Environments (e.g., terrain settings, weather conditions, lighting configurations)
    - Vehicles (e.g., cars, boats, planes, mounts, mechanisms)
    - Effects (e.g., visual effects, sound effects, particle systems, animations)
    - Shops (e.g., item listings, prices, stock, discounts, purchase logic)
    - Events (e.g., in-game events, seasonal activities, scripted triggers)
    - Loot Tables (e.g., drop rates, rare items, randomized rewards)
    - Furniture/Decor (e.g., placeable objects, room layouts, aesthetic items)
    - Weapons (e.g., melee, ranged, magical, unique properties, upgrades)
    - Armor (e.g., defensive gear, bonuses, set effects, durability)
    - Tools (e.g., building tools, farming tools, utility items)

    - Crafting Recipes (e.g., materials required, output items, skill levels)
    - Leaderboards (e.g., scores, rankings, player stats)
    - Achievements (e.g., unlock conditions, rewards, display names)
    - AI Behaviors (e.g., patrol routes, combat patterns, interaction scripts)
    - Soundscapes (e.g., ambient sounds, music tracks, sound triggers)

    - Animations (e.g., character movements, attack sequences, idle poses)
    - UI Elements (e.g., menus, buttons, HUD components, tooltips)
    - Triggers (e.g., area triggers, item pickups, event starters)
    - Maps/Zones (e.g., level layouts, boundaries, teleport points)
    - Economy Systems (e.g., trade systems, market prices, inflation controls)
    - Social Features (e.g., friend lists, guilds, chat systems, party mechanics)


Most of the pluginâ€™s functions are intuitive and self-explanatory, requiring little to no documentation. However, there are certain features and processes that occur in the background, which may not be immediately or fully visible in the user interface. Understanding these can enhance your experience and productivity. Additionally, the documentation includes examples to help you get started quickly and effectively.
